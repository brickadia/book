# Chapter 5: Hosting Servers
In Brickadia, servers allow you to connect with other players. If you are interested in hosting a server for other players, read on!

The two types of servers you will see:
1. [Client Hosting](servers/setup_client.md) - Hosted through the in game client, often hosted in short bursts on a home machine.
2. [Dedicated Server](servers/setup_dedicated.md) - Hosted through a command-line interface, often on another machine that is up for longer periods of time.
