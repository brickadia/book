# Chapter 3: Components
In Brickadia, components are very important for enhancing your builds. In fact, there are many of them placed throughout builds!

Here's a summary of each component and what each one does:

1. [Spot Light](components/spot_light.md) - Places a rotatable and adjustable spotlight.
2. [Point Light](components/point_light.md) - Places an adjustable point light.
3. [Audio](components/audio.md) - Adds sound to a brick.
4. [Item Spawn](components/item_spawn.md) - Spawns items on a brick.
