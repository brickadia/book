# Client Installation

Brickadia has a launcher that will update the game for you, so you'll only need to install it once.

## Windows

Download the Windows installer from [the download page] and run it.

Windows SmartScreen may say that "Windows protected your PC" because the installer has not been run by enough users. To continue, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

If you do not have the **More info** option, you will need to adjust a setting:

1. Open the Windows Defender settings
2. Go to **App & browser control**
3. Under *Check apps and files*, select the **Warn** option instead of the **Block** option
4. Run the installer again

You'll get a shortcut to start Brickadia on your desktop, and several others in your start menu.

## Linux

*The Vulkan renderer in the game is known to be unstable in its current state. If you're experiencing random bouts of crashing, you may want to [try running the game in Proton](./installation_proton.md).*

Brickadia can be started from application entries.

### Debian/Ubuntu

Download the `brickadia-launcher.deb` package from [the download page].

On most distributions, you should be able to open it to install it. If not, run this command:

```bash
sudo apt install ~/Downloads/brickadia-launcher.deb
```

### Other

An official package is not available for any other distributions yet, but you can download an archive of the launcher that should work on most Linux distributions, provided that you find the dependencies.

Download the `brickadia-launcher.tar.xz` archive from [the download page]. Extract it, and run the `brickadia-launcher` file to start the game.
