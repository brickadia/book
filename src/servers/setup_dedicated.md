# Dedicated Server
Brickadia allows you to host a server on a dedicated machine. You may want to do this if:
- You have a VPS/bare metal server spare
- You want to avoid hosting a server on your own machine or home network
- You want to offload the server processing required onto another machine

## Requirements
Before you start this guide, you will need the following:
1. A machine that is running `Windows` or `Linux`
  - For the best reliability, we recommend getting a VPS or a bare metal machine from a server rental company. If you are home hosting off an old laptop, your results may vary.
2. A way to connect to that machine, either through `SSH` or with a keyboard & monitor.

## Guides

## Brickadia Community
[Brickadia Community](https://github.com/brickadia-community) contains a collection of tools made for Brickadia by the community, some of which relate to dedicated servers. You may be interested in [omegga](https://github.com/brickadia-community/omegga), as it allows you to create & use plugins to extend Brickadia servers.
