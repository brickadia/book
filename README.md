# Setup Guide
This repo uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). Reading the official book is recommended, but as long as you understand how markdown works, you are good to go.

## Quick Install
If you have [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed:
`cargo install mdbook`

Otherwise you can download an executable from the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases).
